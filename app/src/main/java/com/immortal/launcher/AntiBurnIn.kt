/**
 * Burn-in mitigation for the always-on screensaver overlay.
 *
 * A Portal that never sleeps shows the same clock in the same pixels for days, and on
 * panels prone to it those pixels age unevenly and ghost. The fix is the classic
 * "pixel shift": nudge the whole overlay by a few pixels so, averaged over time, the
 * bright content is spread across many pixels instead of branding a fixed silhouette.
 *
 * [shift] traces a slow Lissajous path from two incommensurate periods, so the motion
 * never settles into one repeating line (which would just burn a longer streak). It's
 * slow enough to be invisible and small enough not to disturb the layout — the host
 * oversizes the overlay by the same radius so the drift never bares a screen edge.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: the offset is a function of the clock alone, so it's trivially
 * unit-tested and behaves identically on every device.
